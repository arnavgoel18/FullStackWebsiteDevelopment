This thought is truly justified by the radiance of Autokriti, which was yet another flame of passion in the brain of our super seniors. This process of enlightening young minds, began with Autokriti 1.0, where 80 heads hunched over an overhauling 2 stroke engine of a scooter. And then with each step, we escalated newer heights, from Maruti Suzuki in Autokriti 3.0 to Toyota Camry Hybrid engine, season 10 saw us adding electric touch to our workshops. We have come a long way in this beautiful journey, learning and teaching and growing together. But itâ€™s no end."
