                        Knowledge could be gained via two ways- by the path of prolong experimentation and trial & error or from a mentor who could show you a circumscribed path to learning. Isn’t latter the better option? 
                        <br/><br/>
                        SAE NIT Kurukshetra, with its subsidiaries- Team Nitrox and Team Accelerons, is already deep into the technical bog of vehicle designing and manufacturing. And this is what makes Autokriti North India’s largest automobile workshop. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        And so here we are with e-Autokriti 2.0, where we would lay before you the technical know-how unfurled through years of research & implementations. 
                        <br/><br/>
                        This workshop under e - Autokriti 2.0 is a 4-day workshop which will give you an overall idea of working and designing of vehicle’s powertrain.
